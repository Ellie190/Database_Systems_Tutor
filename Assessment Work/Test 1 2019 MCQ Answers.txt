Generalization is like a bottom-up approach in which two or more entities of lower level combine
to form a higher level entity if they have some attributes in common.

Specialization is a process in which an entity is divided into sub-entities. 
You can think of it as a reverse process of generalization, in generalization two entities combine together
to form a new higher level entity. Specialization is a top-down process.
