# Normalisation 
- Normalisation is a data analysis technique to design a database system. 
- It allows the database designer to understand the current data structures in an organisation. 
- it aids any future changes and enhancements to the system.
- Normalisation is a technique for producing relational schema with the following properties:
- No Information Redundancy
- No Update Anomalies
- The end result of normalisation is a set of entities, which removes unnecessary redundancy (i.e. duplication of data) and    avoids the anomalies which will be discussed next.

# Anomalies 
- Anomalies are inconvenient or error-prone situation arising when we process the tables. 

3 types of anomalies
- Update Anomalies 
- Delete Anomalies 
- Insert Anomalies

# The Process of Normalisation 
- Process involves applying a series of tests on a relation to determine whether it satisfies or violates the requirements of a   given normal form.
- When a test fails, the relation is decomposed into simpler relations that individually meet the normalisation tests.
- The higher the normal form the less vulnerable to update anomalies the relations become.
- Three Normal forms: 1NF, 2NF and 3NF were initially proposed by Codd.
- All these normal forms are based on the functional dependencies among the attributes of a relation.

# Normlisation by Example 
- Normalisation is a bottom-up technique for database design, normally based on an existing system (which may be paper-based). 

Bottom-up
- Step 1: Identity data elements 
- Step 2: Group them into datasets
    
Top-down 
- Step 1: Identity datasets
- Step 2: Define data elements

# 1NF Tables: Repeating Attributes Removed

# 1NF to 2NF Tables

             caption = "3NF Table 2")
# To view entire table run df3_2 on the rmarkdown file
```

```{r}
